        <content><![CDATA[<p>Angular 2.0 final was made official just a few days ago and there’s never been a better time to dive in. In the last few weeks, we saw some pretty radical changes to the framework with the addition of the <a href="http://blog.mgechev.com/2016/08/14/ahead-of-time-compilation-angular-offline-precompilation/">Ahead-of-Time</a>(AoT) compiler, introduction of the <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/ngmodule.html">@NgModule</a> decorator and a new<a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/forms.html">Forms Module</a>. In this tutorial we are going to look at what’s changed with forms and more importantly how to handle form validation the right way with Angular 2.</p>
<p>Forms bring life to our applications. It’s how we capture user input and make our applications useful. For a long time, forms have been difficult to get right. Angular 1.x made it a little easier, but came with its own set of issues and challenges, and some features like sane validation didn’t come until the framework was well into it’s 5th year.</p>
<p>Angular 2.x aims to make the creation and validation of forms simple, intuitive, and manageable. Pretty ambitious goals, but with the breadth of knowledge the team has from building Angular 1.x, I think Angular 2 forms can live up to these expectations. Before we dive into writing code, let’s learn a bit about Angular 2 Forms.</p>
<h2 id="angular-2-forms-whats-new-whats-changed"><a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/angular-2-form-validation#angular-2-forms-whats-new-whats-changed"><span class="icon">#</span>Angular 2 Forms - What’s New, What’s Changed</a></h2>
<p>Angular 2.x forms can be written in two ways. Template driven forms, as the name suggests, are forms built entirely in your UI. This is the typical way we built forms in the past and is useful for building very simple forms in Angular 2. Model driven or reactive forms, while similar to template driven forms, add an additional layer of complexity and functionality by having you to declare the model of the form in your component class. This additional functionality allows for greater control over your forms as well as making it easier to unit test your application. We’ll take a look at some of these features in this tutorial.</p>
<h3>SETTING UP OUR APPLICATION</h3>
<p>We will write multiple different forms in this tutorial, with varying levels of complexity. To get started let’s setup our application. If you would like to just follow along, you can get all the code we are going to write from <a href="https://github.com/scotch-io/angular-2-form-validation">this Github repo</a>.</p>
<p>We will setup our application with the <a href="https://cli.angular.io/">Angular CLI</a>. If you don’t already have the CLI installed, run npm install -g angular-cli. Make sure you have the latest version of the CLI, which at the time of this post is beta-15. With the CLI installed, create a new directory called ng2forms and in this directory run ng init. The ng init command will bootstrap our application, download all the external dependencies we’ll need, configure webpack, and basically do all of the setup work for us. Once the ng inithas completed the setup process, navigate to localhost:4200 and you will see a message saying “app works!”</p>]]></content>

        <content><![CDATA[<p>George Bernard Shaw diagnosed the case several years ago; in more recent times popular protest may have already become a social movement. Shaw averred that "every profession is a conspiracy against the laity." The contemporary publics are responding as though they have made the same discovery. Few of the modern professionals seem to be immune from the popular attack-- whether they be social workers, educators, housers, public health officials, policemen, city planners, highway engineers or physicians. Our restive clients have been telling us that they don't like the educational programs that schoolmen have been offering, the redevelopment projects urban renewal agencies have been proposing, the lawenforcement styles of the police, the administrative behavior of the welfare agencies, the locations of the highways, and so on. In the courts, the streets, and the political campaigns, we've been hearing ever-louder public protests against the professions' diagnoses of the clients' problems, against professionally designed governmental programs, against professionally certified standards for the public services. It does seem odd that this attack should be coming just when professionals in * This is a modification of a paper presented to the Panel on Policy Sciences, American Association for the Advancement of Science, Boston, December 1969. 12 155 the social services are beginning to acquire professional competencies. It might seem that our publics are being perverse, having condoned professionalism when it was really only dressed-up amateurism and condemning professionalism when we finally seem to be getting good at our jobs. Perverse though the laity may be, surely the professionals themselves have been behind this attack as well. Some of the generators of the confrontation have been intellectual in origin. The anti-professional movement stems in part from a reconceptualization of the professional's task. Others are more in the character of historical imperatives, i.e. conditions have been thrown up by the course of societal events that call for different modes of intervention. The professional's job was once seen as solving an assortment of problems that appeared to be definable, understandable and consensual. He was hired to eliminate those conditions that predominant opinion judged undesirable. His record has been quite spectacular, of course; the contemporary city and contemporary urban society stand as clean evidences of professional prowess. The streets have been paved, and roads now connect all places; houses shelter virtually everyone; the dread diseases are virtually gone; clean water is piped into nearly every building; sanitary sewers carry wastes from them; schools and hospitals serve virtually every district; and so on. The accomplishments of the past century in these respects have been truly phenomenal, however short of some persons' aspirations they might have been. But now that these relatively easy problems have been dealt with, we have been turning our attention to others that are much more stubborn. The tests for efficiency, that were once so useful as measures of accomplishment, are being challenged by a renewed preoccupation with consequences for equity. The seeming consensus, that might once have allowed distributional problems to be dealt with, is being eroded by the growing awareness of the nation's pluralism and of the differentiation of values that accompanies differentiation of publics. The professionalized cognitive and occupational styles that were refined in the first half of this century, based in Newtonian mechanistic physics, are not readily adapted to contemporary conceptions of interacting open systems and to contemporary concerns with equity. A growing sensitivity to the waves of repercussions that ripple through such systemic networks and to the value consequences of those repercussions has generated the recent reexamination of received values and the recent search for national goals. There seems to be a growing realization that a weak strut in the professional's support system lies at the juncture where goal-formulation, problem-definition and equity issues meet. We should like to address these matters in turn.</p>
<p>The search for explicit goals was initiated in force with the opening of the 1960s. In a 1960 RAND publication, Charles J. Hitch urged that "We must learn to look at our objectives as critically and as professionally as we look at our models and our other inputs." 1 The subsequent work in systems analysis reaffirmed that injunction. 1 Charles J. Hitch, "On the Choice of Objectives in Systems Studies" (Santa Monica, California: The RAND Corporation, 1960; P-1955), p. 19. 156 Men in a wide array of fields were prompted to redefine the systems they dealt with in the syntax of verbs rather than nouns--to ask "What do the systems do ?" rather than "What are they made of?"--and then to ask the most difficult question of all: "What shouM these systems do ?" Also 1960 was inaugurated with the publication of Goals for Americans, the report of President Eisenhower's Commission on National Goals.2 There followed then a wave of similar efforts. The Committee for Economic Development commissioned a fo!low-u p re-examination. So did the Brookings Institution, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and then President Nixon through his National Goals Research Staff. But2these may be only the most apparent attempts to clarify the nation's directions.3 Perhaps more symptomatic in the U.S. were the efforts to install PPBS, which requires explication of desired outcomes; and then the more recent attempts to build systems of social indicators, which are in effect surrogates for statements of desired conditions. As we all now know, it has turned out to be terribly difficult, if not impossible, to make either of these systems operational. Although there are some small success stories recounted in a few civilian agencies, successes are still rare. Goal-finding is turning out to be an extraordinarily obstinate task. Because goal-finding is one of the central functions of planning, we shall shortly want to ask why that must be so. At the same time that these formalized attempts were being made to discover our latent aims, the nation was buffeted by the revolt of the blacks, then by the revolt of the students, then by the widespread revolt against the war, more recently with a new consumerism and conservationism. All these movements were striking out at the underlying systemic processes of contemporary American society. In a style rather different from those of the systems analysts and the Presidential commissioners, participants in these revolts were seeking to restructure the value and goal systems that affect the distribution of social product and shape the directions of national policy. Systems analysis, goals commissions, PPBS, social indicators, the several revolts, the poverty program, model cities, the current concerns with environmental quality and with the qualities of urban life, the search for new religions among contemporary youth, and the increasing attractiveness of the planning idea--all seem to be driven by a common quest. Each in its peculiar way is asking for a clarification of purposes, for a redefinition of problems, for a re-ordering of priorities to match stated purposes, for the design of new kinds of goal-directed actions, for a reorientation of the professions to the outputs of professional activities rather than to the inputs into them, and then for a redistribution of the outputs of governmental programs among the competing publics. A deep-running current of optimism in American thought seems to have been propelling these diverse searches for direction-finding instruments. But at the same time, the Americans' traditional faith in a guaranteed Progress is being eroded by the same waves that are wearing down old beliefs in the social order's inherent goodness and in history's intrinsic benevolence. Candide is dead. His place is being 2 The report was published by Spectrum Books, Prentice-Hall, 1960. 3 At the same time to be sure, counter voices--uncomfortable to many--were claiming that the "nation's direction" presents no meaningful reference system at all, owing to the worldwide character of the problems and the overspill of crises across national boundaries. 157 occupied by a new conception of future history that, rejecting historicism, is searching for ways of exploiting the intellectual and inventive capabilities of men. This belief comes in two quite contradictory forms. On the one hand, there is the belief in the "makeability," or unrestricted malleability, of future history by means of the planning intellect--by reasoning, rational discourse, and civilized negotiation. At the same time, there are vocal proponents of the "feeling approach," of compassionate engagement and dramatic action, even of a revival of mysticism, aiming at overcoming The System which is seen as the evil source of misery and suffering. The Enlightenment may be coming to full maturity in the late 20th century, or it may be on its deathbed. Many Americans seem to believe both that we can perfect future history--that we can deliberately shape future outcomes to accord with our wishes--and that there will be no future history. Some have arrived at deep pessimism and some at resignation. To them, planning for large social systems has proved to be impossible without loss of liberty and equity. Hence, for them the ultimate goal of planning should be anarchy, because it should aim at the elimination of government over others. Still another group has arrived at the conclusion that liberty and equity are luxuries which cannot be afforded by a modern society, and that they should be substituted by "cybernetically feasible" values. Professionalism has been understood to be one of the major instruments for perfectability, an agent sustaining the traditional American optimism. Based in modern science, each of the professions has been conceived as the medium through which the knowledge of science is applied. In effect, each profession has been seen as a subset of engineering. Planning and the emerging policy sciences are among the more optimistic of those professions. Their representatives refuse to believe that planning for betterment is impossible, however grave their misgivings about the appropriateness of past and present modes of planning. They have not abandoned the hope that the instruments of perfectability can be perfected. It is that view that we want to examine, in an effort to ask whether the social professions are equipped to do what they are expected to do. H. Problem Definition During the industrial age, the idea of planning, in common with the idea of professionalism, was dominated by the pervasive idea of efficiency. Drawn from 18th century physics, classical economics and the principle of least-means, efficiency was seen as a condition in which a specified task could be performed with low inputs of resources. That has been a powerful idea. It has long been the guiding concept of civil engineering, the scientific management movement, much of contemporary operations research; and it still pervades modern government and industry. When attached to the idea of planning, it became dominating there too. Planning was then seen as a process of designing problem-solutions that might be installed and operated cheaply. Because it was fairly easy to get consensus on the nature of problems during the early industrial period, the task could be assigned to the technically skilled, who in turn could be trusted to accomplish the simplified end-in-view. Or, in the more work-a-day setting, we could rely upon the efficiency expert to diagnose a problem 158 and then solve it, while simultaneously reducing the resource inputs into whatever it was we were doing. We have come to think about the planning task in very different ways in recent years. We have been learning to ask whether what we are doing is the right thing to do. That is to say, we have been learning to ask questions about the outputs of actions and to pose problem statements in valuative frameworks. We have been learning to see social processes as the links tying open systems into large and interconnected networks of systems, such that outputs from one become inputs to others. In that structural framework it has become less apparent where problem centers lie, and less apparent where and how we should intervene even if we do happen to know what aims we seek. We are now sensitized to the waves of repercussions generated by a problem-solving action directed to any one node in the network, and we are no longer surprised to find it inducing problems of greater severity at some other node. And so we have been forced to expand the boundaries of the systems we deal with, trying to internalize those externalities. This was the professional style of the systems analysts, who were commonly seen as forebearers of the universal problem-solvers. With arrogant confidence, the early systems analysts pronounced themselves ready to take on anyone's perceived problem, diagnostically to discover its hidden character, and then, having exposed its true nature, skillfully to excise its root causes. Two decades of experience have worn the self-assurances thin. These analysts are coming to realize how valid their model really is, for they themselves have been caught by the very same diagnostic difficulties that troubled their clients. By now we are all beginning to realize that one of the most intractable problems is that of defining problems (of knowing what distinguishes an observed condition from a desired condition) and of locating problems (finding where in the complex causal networks the trouble really lies). In turn, and equally intractable, is the problem of identifying the actions that might effectively narrow the gap between what-is and what-ought-to-be. As we seek to improve the effectiveness of actions in pursuit of valued outcomes, as system boundaries get stretched, and as we become more sophisticated about the complex workings of open societal systems, it becomes ever more difficult to make the planning idea operational. Many now have an image of how an idealized planning system would function. It is being seen as an on-going, cybernetic process of governance, incorporating systematic procedures for continuously searching out goals; identifying problems; forecasting uncontrollable contextual changes; inventing alternative strategies, tactics, and timesequenced actions; stimulating alternative and plausible action sets and their consequences; evaluating alternatively forecasted outcomes; statistically monitoring those conditions of the publics and of systems that are judged to be germane; feeding back information to the simulation and decision channels so that errors can be corrected--all in a simultaneously functioning governing process. That set of steps is familiar to all of us, for it comprises what is by now the modern-classical model of planning. And yet we all know that such a planning system is unattainable, even as we seek more closely to approximate it. It is even questionable whether such a planning system is desirable.</p>]]></content>
        <shortDescription><![CDATA[<p>The search for scientific bases for confronting problems of social policy is bound to fail, because of the nature of these problems. They are "wicked" problems, whereas science has developed to deal with "tame" problems. Policy problems cannot be definitively described. Moreover, in a pluralistic society there is nothing like the undisputable public good; there is no objective definition of equity; policies that respond to social problems cannot be meaningfully correct or false; and it makes no sense to talk about "optinaal solutions" to social probIems unless severe qualifications are imposed first.

        <content><![CDATA[<p>The academic field of human-computer interaction was born in a time when digital products and services were used more or less exclusively for instrumental purposes in work-oriented settings. A human-resources administrator using a payroll database in 1975 or a sales representative using a spreadsheet in 1990 would need to get the job done as efficiently and correctly as possible, for the good of the employer, enterprise or client. Usability and utility were always the primary goals of human-computer interaction, and for good reason. The digitization of information-related tasks has not subsided in the workplace; if anything, the use of digital products and services for instrumental and externally motivated purposes is increasing. However, a complementary class of digital products and services has emerged and is rapidly becoming the dominant one in the eyes of the general public. I am referring to the class of hedonistic use, where the user engages with a digital product or service because she wants to. She may be seeking pleasure, excitement, closeness, fantasy, status, or a million other things— but she is not primarily interested in getting a job done for someone else as efficiently and correctly as possible. Games, music players, cell phones, digital broadcast media, and web pages are all examples of digital products and services that currently appear in hedonistic use more often than in instrumental use. The use of such products and services is largely discretionary; users become more of a consumer in the sense that they choose between competing offerings. It is rather obvious that when considering hedonistic and discretionary use, it is important for designers to focus on the look and feel of the digital products and services, or rather: how the user feels about the way the products look, feel, and behave. To put it simply, chances are better that people will choose a product if it appeals to them. This insight is at the core of the emerging turn towards user experience in the field of human-computer interaction. More mature design disciplines, such as industrial design and architecture, treat experiential concerns—how the user feels about the way the products look, feel, and behave—as given elements on the designer’s agenda and use the traditional background in applied arts to address them adequately. I consider interaction design as a design discipline, closely affiliated with other design disciplines in terms of work processes (Löwgren, 1995) and in terms of being driven equally by instrumental, ethical, and aesthetic forces (Löwgren &amp; Stolterman, 2004). What sets interaction design apart from other design disciplines, however, is the nature of the design material that interaction designers shape into products and services. Information and communication technology is our design material, and unlike the materials of industrial design and traditional architecture, it is temporal as Received September 26, 2007; Accepted November 23, 2007; Published December 1, 2007 Copyright: © 2007 Löwgren.

Corresponding Author: jonas.lowgren@mah.se Fluency as an Experiential Quality in Augmented Spaces Jonas Löwgren Malmö University, Malmö, Sweden The use of digital products and services has expanded from largely instrumental, work-oriented settings to include entertainment, leisure, personal communication, and other classes of hedonistic use. The development of foundational concepts in the interaction design community to succeed usability and utility has lagged behind considerably. I argue that interaction design would benefit from attempts to articulate experiential qualities of digital products and services, and illustrate the approach by presenting the concept of fluency. It refers to the degree of gracefulness with which the user deals with multiple demands for her attention and action, particularly in augmented spaces where the user moves through shifting ecologies of people, physical objects, and digital media. I develop the concept of fluency by analyzing a range of digital artifacts in use situations, addressing the main themes of (1) social norms and practices and (2) peripheral interaction and calm technology. In terms of research methodology, this paper illustrates how design and criticism can be merged to construct elements of transferable knowledge for communication with design-research communities. Keywords - Fluency, Experiential Qualities, Interaction Design. Relevance to Design Practice - One of the key elements in professional design ability is assessment, i.e., judging how “good” a design idea is. Fluency and other experiential qualities are concepts that professional designers can use to develop their assessment skills and hence design better products. Citation: Löwgren, J. (2007). Fluency as an experiential quality in augmented spaces. International Journal of Design, 1(3), 1-10. original article www.ijdesign.org 2 International Journal of Design Vol.1 No.3 2007 Fluency as an Experiential Quality in Augmented Spaces much as it is spatial. This is to say that the properties of digital artifacts are determined by their temporal form, as well as by their spatial form. Spatial form considerations include, for example, the two-dimensional appearance of a screen-based interface, the threedimensional form of a handheld device, or the mixed-reality space of a room-sized projection-plus-camera system. Temporal form is the way that the user’s interaction with an artifact develops over time. Just as the user’s impressions of spatial form is contingent on the designer’s decisions on shapes, materials, colors, and shape relationships, so is her impressions of temporal form shaped by the designer’s decisions on the behaviors of the artifact. Of course, I am not unaware of the importance of the temporal aspects in design disciplines, such as architecture and industrial design. What I am arguing, however, is that digital products and services are generally highly interactive and that the digital design materials generally entail greater interactional complexity than the materials of architecture or product design. The interaction designer typically devotes more effort to the detailed shaping of behavior than an architect or industrial designer would. Hence, I find the spatial+temporal nature of interaction design materials to be a defining characteristic of the field. The spatial+temporal nature of our design material means, among other things, that the use of experiential concepts from other design disciplines must always be a deliberate act rather than a straightforward transfer. As we saw in the early days of web design, the exquisite visual balance of space and negative space on the individual pages of a web site is of little consequence if the user’s path through the site creates an overall impression of fragmented material in labyrinthic structures. However, a reappropriated understanding of balance can be quite useful for interaction design in determining the distribution of functions between a handheld device and a desktop computer in a multidevice service. More generally, I conclude that interaction design needs its own set of experiential concepts that are strongly oriented towards how the interaction feels. Consider, for instance, how the noticeable latency in menu selection on an early cell phone made the whole device seem brittle and unreliable. Or how the scroll speed gauge and ease-in-out scroll animations of Picasa lend a sense of solidity and impact to the images rendered in the overview area. Or how the fine-grained loop of anticipation and visuo-tactile feedback fosters a sense of curiousity about the data presented in a dynamic query. These are all examples of key experiential qualities stemming from the spatial+temporal nature of digital design materials. The Need to Articulate Concepts I will argue that interaction design needs its own concepts to capture the key experiential qualities of using digital products and services. But why does the field need concepts at all? I see a design discipline, such as interaction design, as a discursive community consisting of practicing designers, design researchers, critics, and other professionals devoted to maintaining and growing a body of knowledge for design (Krippendorff, 2006). Contributions to the community are statements (in a broad sense—including innovative design examples, war stories, best practices, scientific research findings) that are deemed by its originating community member to be of value for other community members. Each statement is assessed by overt and tacit community mechanisms (including review and jury processes), appropriated by community members who find it interesting, possibly elaborated, modified, or refuted in an ongoing community process of what Krippendorff calls the languaging of design. In this perspective, the act of articulating and communicating experiential concepts can be seen as statements forming potential contributions to the community’s joint body of knowledge. More specifically, the two main strands of design practice on a very high level of abstraction are to generate ideas and assess ideas. The notion of patterns, which has attracted significant interest in interaction design practice and research in the last ten years (see Borchers, 2001; Van Duyne, Landay, &amp; Hong, 2002; Arvola, 2004), can be seen as an attempt to articulate and communicate practical knowing to support other designers in the generation of ideas. A close analogy for the assessment side is the notion of experiential qualities (which were called “use qualities” in Löwgren, 2006 and earlier work): articulations of key qualities in the use of a certain genre of digital artifacts, intended for other designers to appropriate in order to develop their own judgment ability, and to elaborate and modify drawing on their own experience. Many experiential qualities that characterize aspects of using digital products and services in different genres can be identified. Shedroff (2001), for example, talks about seductive, adaptive, and creative experiences. Another example, slightly more fine-grained, is the notion of pliability—the sense of involving, malleable, and tightly coupled interaction—that I identify as conducive to exploration and serendipitous discovery in the genre of interactive visualizations (Löwgren, 2007). In the present paper, I introduce the experiential quality of fluency for the interaction-design genre of augmented spaces. The next section defines the genre and then develops the concept of fluency by introducing a range of carefully chosen examples of digital artifacts in use in augmented spaces and discussing what characterizes them in terms of user experience. This section, which is the core of the paper, is followed by an overview of related work and related concepts. The paper closes with a discussion of the methodological characteristics of the work and its implications for further design research and practice. Fluency and the Experience of Life in Augmented Spaces Multiple digital media streams are increasingly infusing our everyday life and workspaces. In Manovich’s (2006) words, we might say that augmented space is increasingly becoming a reality of everyday life. People carry cell phones, music players and other connected digital devices; they move in and out of contact with TV, radio, workplace awareness and other mass-media streams Jonas Löwgren is professor of interaction design at Malmö University, Sweden. His work is focused on cross-media design, interactive visualization, and the design theory of the digital materials. More information is available at http://webzone.k3.mah.se/k3jolo. www.ijdesign.org 3 International Journal of Design Vol.1 No.3 2007 J. Löwgren as well as email, phone, instant messaging, and other personal media streams in the course of the day. This dance between media streams takes place in a social and urban landscape where millions of people and objects potentially attract and deserve attention and action. The focus of this paper is on people’s everyday life in augmented spaces. The perspective is rather holistic, with an emphasis on how the use of digital artifacts intertwines with all the other practices that, taken together, make up everyday life. The “always-connected” ideal of mobile communication has long become obsolete, and there is a growing concern about the downsides of communication overload and infostress. My aim here is to take an interaction design critic’s approach to understanding how digital artifacts can make our life in augmented spaces more graceful, more manageable, more pleasant—in short, how we can dance more fluently among the media streams of everyday life. The concept of fluency is an attempt to capture the experiential quality I am seeking. Broadly speaking, it refers to the degree of gracefulness with which the users deals with multiple demands for their attention and action. In this section, I aim at providing a sense of what fluency means in interaction design by analyzing a range of use experiences of digital artifacts in augmented spaces. The examples are selected carefully to cover the key elements of fluency, and they fall into two broad categories: one concerned with fluency in relation to social norms and practices, and the other addressing peripheral interaction and calm technology</p>]]></content>

        <content><![CDATA[<p>As technologies become woven intro the fabric of everyday life, we are urged to consider in what way these technologies promote human engagement and invite us to invest our skill, knowledge and time in interaction. In our own research, the issue of engaging interaction has been a central tenet emerging from our effort in domains ranging from urban settings to museums and libraries. Museums, as an example, strive to engage visitors in exploring cultural or natural history. In their efforts to do so, many museums have looked in the direction of interactive technologies in the hope that this will provide new ways for visitors to relate to exhibition spaces and new avenues of learning. Research efforts have illustrated that there is indeed potential in using new technologies and interaction styles to promote engagement. However, it seems that interaction design, as a field of research as well as practice, is in need of a richer conceptualization of the potentials of interactive technologies in promoting engagement. This challenge can be addressed both on a general level by developing theories about engagement and on a concrete level by exploring particular interaction styles, concepts and technologies. In this paper we move across this span of abstraction by first presenting a general conception of engagement based on pragmatist philosophy, followed by a discussion of a particular means for creating engagement, namely the concept of peepholes. By peepholes, we refer to aspects of interactive artifacts and environments that utilize the tension between what is hidden and what is revealed to foster engagement through curiosity and inquiry. Keyholes may be the archetypical peepholes – they provide a limited view into a larger context, revealing some aspects but not providing the viewer with the entire situation. Peepholes provide a glimpse of a hidden, secret or even forbidden world. They play on our imagination and our inquisitive nature as we are PETER DALSGAARD &amp; CHRISTIAN DINDLER DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATION AND MEDIA STUDIES UNIVERSITY OF AARHUS, 8200 AARHUS N, DENMARK TEL: +45 89429285, +45 89429282 E-MAIL: DALSGAARD@CAVI.DK, IMVCDI@HUM.AU.DK PEEPHOLES AS MEANS OF ENGAGEMENT IN INTERACTION DESIGN Engaging Artifacts 2009 Oslo www.nordes.org 2 drawn to disclose the world that is hidden. Peepholes are well known in the worlds of art and architecture as means of shaping curiosity. Here, we will articulate peepholes within the field of interaction design as a particular means of engagement that invites people to engage in mixed reality environments. As we will discuss throughout these paragraphs, peepholes may be realized through a range of modalities such as visual, tactile, etc. We seek to shed light on the qualities of peepholes, as well as to illustrate the potentials in a pragmatist conception of engagement as a foundation for discussing both over-arching conceptualizations of engagement as well as particular qualities of designed interactive environments. The structure of the paper is such that we first outline the concept of engagement. We draw upon related work from the field of interaction design and move towards a pragmatist conceptualization of engagement. The pragmatist perspective gives rise to an understanding of engagement as emergent and relational, constituted not only by the relation between a subject and an interactive artifact, but as a phenomenon that develops in the complex transactions between people, physico-spatial surroundings, socio-cultural practices, and technologies. Building on this perspective, we develop the notion of means of engagement as the particular constructs that are intentionally shaped through design to mediate our engagement in the world. We briefly discuss four existing interactive installations that employ peepholes to foster engagement. We then present in more depth two experimental design cases in which we have employed and developed the notion of peepholes. ENGAGING INTERACTION DESIGN Our motivation for addressing the notion of engagement with interactive systems is to highlight and explore the ways in which people invest their talents, time, curiosity and resources in relation to interactive artifacts and environments. In a broad sense, engagement is a general perspective that highlights certain qualities or aspects of peoples’ lives. Our interest here is to unfold a concept of engagement that will shed light on peoples’ relation to interactive systems and the environments in which these exist. Within the field of interaction design, academic contributions addressing experiential phenomena have to a large extent focused on arguments for the necessity of addressing experiential aspects and on establishing definitions and frameworks for understanding the concept of experience (e.g. McCarthy &amp; Wright 2004, Batterbee 2004). Recently, Löwgren (2007) argued that the field would benefit from articulating particular experiential qualities of digital artifacts. Löwgren (2007) has provided examples of this approach in discussing the qualities of ‘fluency’ (Löwgren 2007A) and ‘pliability’ (Löwgren 2007B), as has McCarthy et al. (2006) with regards to ‘enchantment’. We do not see engagement as an experiential quality on par with e.g. fluency or pliability. Rather, it resides on a higher level of abstraction and as such may be regarded as a metaquality that encompasses a number of distinct experiential qualities. E.g. in a given situation, an artifact with a fluent and pliable interaction gestalt may promote engagement, whereas other situations may be un-engaging in spite of the presence of fluent and pliable gestalts. In the following, we will weave our own observations and related work from interaction design and beyond in order to outline a conception of engagement. SITUATED AND RELATIONAL PROPERTIES OF ENGAGEMENT Engagement with interactive systems is fundamentally embedded in particular situations and cultural practices. When we design an interactive installation for e.g. a library, we need to explore the various components that constitute the library situation as encountered by guests, including physical spaces, cultural forms of practice, mediating artifacts, rhythms of movement and social interactions. A focus on the qualities of the “object” alone is thus too narrow to capture the forces at play in the transactions of engagement. This point is developed in depth by Arnold Berleant and his work on aesthetic theory. Berleant (1991) proposes the explanatory concept of engagement as the participatory alternative to the aesthetic concept of disinterestedness and illustrates throughout his work the essentially participatory nature of appreciating art, nature, and the human built environment. Some forms of participation are overt in nature and require people to physically interact with the artwork – e.g. an artwork may require people to physically interaction in order to experience the artwork. Yet, Berleant argues, even more “traditional” artworks require participatory engagement in that they are realized in the reciprocal relation between person and artwork. When we are immersed in aesthetic appreciation of an artwork, e.g. a painting, it is a process of participatory engagement in which we may imaginatively enter and explore the space of the painting. Moreover, engagement, according to Berleant, Engaging Artifacts 2009 Oslo www.nordes.org 3 unfolds within a complex field of forces – the aesthetic field - that shape peoples experience Berleant (1970) MOTIVATION AND ENGAGEMENT Engagement is fundamentally tied to motivation; what drives or inspires us to invest our resources in a situation. The issue of motivation is complex as it encompasses both long term, high level motivation that gives direction to peoples lives as well as particular situations and objects in our everyday dealings that may motivate us to engage in particular activities. Working from cultural-historical psychology, Hedegaard (1995) explicitly distinguishes between “motivation” as the dynamics that characterizes a person’s activity and relation to the surroundings in concrete situations and “motives” denoting the long term goals that have impact on a person over extended periods of time. Moreover, as argued by Hedegaard (1995), individual motivation is developed through our participation in cultural forms of practice that in them selves are crystallizations of historical motives. Motivation concerns the issue of investment; what people put at stake in the situation whether this is time, belief or other forms of resources. In his seminal work on optimal experience, Csikszentmihalyi (1990) showed how the flow experience is achieved when there is an optimal fit between challenge and skills. In this sense, flow describes the balances between what is invested in a situation and how the situation responds – the transactional process. Here, we shall not attempt to cover the depth of the concept of motivation but note that motivation may spring from long term goals or interests and may be more situated and opportunistic in nature; certain surroundings may motivate to invest our skills and knowledge in particular activities. Arguably, motivation most often spring from the relations between these two archetypes. So far, we have discussed engagement as a relational phenomenon that is dependent to what people bring to the situation in terms of motivation. In order to more fully articulate the concept of engagement, we do however need to account for engagement as an emergent property extended in time. DEPTH AND UNFOLDEDNESS AS PROPERTIES OF ENGAGEMENT Borgman (1995) argues that settings that inspire engagement have a certain unfoldedness and depth; a wealth of experiential properties and their disclosing powers. In continuation of the motivation underpinning our engagement in situations, this can imply both the motivation to uncover or unfold new phenomena in our surroundings, or to explore in more depth seemingly well-known phenomena. Borgman uses the example of the artefacts that inhabit the kitchen of a gourmet cook – burners, pots, chopping blocks etc. – and the way in which the handling of these artifacts disclose their experiential properties. The sound of the pot as food is stirred at just the right temperature. This environment invites people to invest their skills, time and resources and to be engagement in the activity of preparing the meal. Borgman’s example also highlights the evolving character of engagement – qualities are disclosed through the transactions between the chef and the artefacts in her kitchen. McCarthy et al. (2006) further address this issue of unfoldedness or depth in relation to the potentials for enchantment in interactive systems. They note that interactive systems that are to evoke enchantment should offer potential for the unexpected and the opportunity for discovering new aspects or qualities of the system. The unfoldedness and depth of particular artefacts is however closely tied to socio-cultural forms of practice in any given situation. In the example of the kitchen, the use of the artefacts is closely tied to the practices of the kitchen. The trainee chef’s engagement with the artefacts is fundamentally shaped by the instructions given by more experienced chefs and particular task with which s/he is assigned. Again, this is a reciprocal relationship as we may see the artefacts themselves as crystallizations of particular forms of practice. This example does, however, highlight another fundamental issue in talking about engagement, namely what it is we are engaged with. The trainee chef is arguably engaged with learning to use the filet knife in the proper way. In another sense, the trainee chef is also engaged in the activity of preparing a meal where the tools are the means with which to achieve this. Heidegger’s well known distinction between ready-at-hand and presentat-hand has been used extensively to explore how artefacts and interfaces may become transparent and allow the user to work through the artefacts while artefacts sometimes become the very object of attention when their working breaks down. As argued by Verbeek (2005), the answer does however not have to be eitheror – present-at-hand or ready-at-hand. Verbeek (2005) argues that we may understand this as a continuum in that artifacts may mediate our engagement with the Engaging Artifacts 2009 Oslo www.nordes.org 4 world but at the same time require our attention and the exercise of skill. TEMPORAL AND TRANSACTIONAL PROPERTIES OF ENGAGEMENT Berleant’s concept of participatory engagement urges us to consider the continuity between people and the forces at play in our environment – as transactions between mutually determining forces. Yet it is obvious that some artifacts, situations and environments seem to be more conductive of engagement and successfully capture people – be this art, technology or nature. As we have now begun to conceptualize engagement as an emergent quality we have yet to consider how engagement unfolds as a process extended in time. From our conceptions so far, it is obvious that we are dealing with a dynamic concept and we are forced to account for this dynamics in order to more fully articulate the concept. To this end, we turn to the concept of transaction as laid out by pragmatist philosopher John Dewey, whose work has heavily inspired the aforementioned contributions from Berleant and McCarthy et al. We regard the concept of transaction as being capable of capturing the dynamics of how engagement unfolds. One of the pivotal concepts in the work of Dewey (1934) is inquiry; the mode of experience and action by which the subject seeks to make sense of challenging situations and resolve or overcome the tensions they present; in Deweyan terminology, this is described as a transformation of indeterminate situations into determinate ones. In this perspective, the subject is an active and integral part of the situation, not an outside party to it. Situation in this perspective encompasses the subject, other people, the physical things in the world, and socio-cultural constructs. This notion of situation is analogous with Berleant’s (1970) understanding of the aesthetic field as the inseparable and mutually influential forces that shape engagement. The transactional perspective in Deweyan pragmatism highlights the reciprocal relationship between people and the situation – through inquiry people coordinate and shape the situation and in turn, people are shaped themselves. Building upon Dewey, Schön (1983) showed by way of example how we might conceive of design as a movement, where people make inquiries or “moves” within a situation and the situation, in turn, talks back. In the same sense, engagement unfolds in time as the iterative transformations between people and situation as inquiries shape both. In inquiry, we often rely upon various resources in the situation in order to proceed. These resources include our repertoire of past experiences and habitual ways of relating to the world, as well as contextual resources, e.g. artifacts, physic-spatial surroundings, other people in the situation, socio-cultural norms etc. Inspired by Deweyan pragmatism, Gedenryd (1998) employs the term situating strategies to this resourceful approach; in his work, he emphasizes that competent practitioners develop a multitude of ways of bringing these resources to supplement and augment their reflection and action. In line with this, Hickman (1990) has explored in depth the role of instruments and tools in Dewey’s conception of inquiry. Hickman explicates that Dewey’s conception of technology is inclusive, denoting all of those resources that we bring to bear in the resolution of tensions and challenges in a situation. Since inquiry is central to Deweyan pragmatism, and technology is an integral part of inquiry, Hickman thus suggests that we may consider pragmatism a philosophy of technology. Although it may seem a digression from our exploration of engagement, this understanding of technology as an integral component of inquiry is in fact crucial to our line of argument: technologies are not just functional tools employed to carry out intended operations, they also influence our initial perception of a situation, our experience of inquiry, and our feeling of fulfilment when a challenging situation is resolved. In this manner, interactive artifacts and environments may function as means of engagement</p>]]></content>

        <content><![CDATA[<p>As human–computer interaction (HCI) and interactive systems design have developed a sense of people living with and through technologies, our concerns have broadened from usability to include wider qualities of people’s experiences with technology. User experience has become a focal interest in leading HCI textbooks, e.g. [1], monographs [2– 5], edited collections [6] and even the websites of leading manufacturers. There have also been specific technical proposals for enhancing people’s experience with computers. For example, Garrett [7] proposed a conceptual integration of information design, information architecture, and interface design to improve user experience of websites. Design principles and guidelines promoting transparency, seamlessness, and tangibility as enriching user experience have also emerged. Such technical responses may be premature. Before embracing any technical response, clear understandings of user experience are required. We argue that, despite recent attention, the concept of user experience is still underdeveloped in HCI. One way of working with the richness and complexity of user experience in HCI is to develop conceptual frameworks for design and analysis that attempt to express aspects of it [3, 8]. Another is to document varieties of experiences with technology. In this paper, we examine the experience of enchantment through this second approach. It would be unremarkable to view a film, concert, or book review that described the experience as enchanting. Such events in art and literature, which challenge and engage the whole person, may be designed to enchant. In contrast, it could be argued that functional tools cannot be judged by similar criteria. But, in our view, experience of interacting with technologies such as a treadle sewing machine, a great piece of architecture, or a classic motorcar could also be described as enchanting. However, as enchantment and interactive systems do not go together so easily, some justification for even using the term is required. Let’s start with a personal experience. Enchantment precisely describes one of the author’s first encounters with a personal computer and his more recent encounter with Apple’s Titanium G4 Powerbook. Both radically challenged assumptions about what computing is and can be and particularly about relationships between aesthetics and function. The G4 Powerbook, for example, evoked space travel, weightlessness, artistic creativity, and even television or cinema screen culture. Not associations he had previously made with computers and computing. Other people are enchanted with the Internet, cell phones, cyber-communities, or computer games. At the very least, HCI needs to tangle with the concept of enchantment in order to understand people’s affective attachments to particular interactive systems. But more than that, it needs to recognise enchantment as an experience that people may desire in the systems they use—especially when that use is discretionary. In what follows, we seek to develop an understanding of enchantment that can usefully be applied to the analysis and design of interactive systems. 2 The enchantment of technology We begin by examining previous accounts of the general phenomenon of the enchantment of technology. What happens when we find ourselves affectively attached to technology? And how is the particular experience of enchantment different from other affective responses? According to the anthropologist Gell [9], enchantment with technology involves being carried away by the power behind the technology. Gell worked mainly with people from pre-industrial societies such as the Trobriand Islands. One aspect of their lives that interested him was their use of art—for him a kind of technology—to enchant their enemies. The Trobrianders’ construction of the prow-board of the Kula canoe is a case in point. The board is a visually intricate display or surface designed to dazzle anybody looking at it and put them off their stroke for a moment. Gell attributes the power of the canoe-board not to its visual appearance per se but to viewers’ interpretations of the visual effects as evidence of magical power behind the making of the board. While Gell’s analysis provides a useful starting point for our exploration of enchantment, it seems to offer limited value to interaction designers, suggesting that the complexity of a technology might, in itself, be sufficient to lead to enchantment—contradicting much that is known about the interaction of humans with technology. Gell’s analysis also lacks the sense of charm, delight, and pleasure that enchantment could connote, and his description of enchanting experience renders the viewer passive and helpless. In contrast, our interest in enchantment with cell phones and G4 Powerbooks seems more like an active engagement with the sensory qualities of the artefact. Bennett’s [10] description of enchantment is more helpful. She sees enchantment in terms of being “both caught up and carried away” (p.5). One aspect is certainly a sense of being disoriented, but this disorientation is not necessarily wedded to fear. For her, the disorientation is associated with a pleasurable sense of fullness and liveliness that charges attention and concentration. This combination of emotional attachment together with a sense of something not yet understood leaves us feeling disrupted but also alive, attentive, and curious. Enchantment does not necessarily imply that the object of enchantment must be novel or extraordinary, rather that the person sees how rich and extraordinary the everyday and familiar can be. In the prosaic world in which we live, all encounters contain the possibility of something unexpected. Fisher [11] points out how remembering and explaining can be antagonistic to this sense of wonder. Relying on our memories of what a situation is like, rather than engaging directly with it, inhibits wonder and enchantment. Focusing on readymade descriptions and explanations forecloses on the potential in a situation. In a way then enchantment describes what we often miss in the ordinary, everyday, world because we have already defined and finalised it in our minds, neglecting to look more closely. Because of this, we fail to notice the essential creativity of our relationship with everything that is ordinary. Bettelheim’s [12] exploration of the enchantment of fairy tales for children draws attention to this creative process and also warns against explanation. He argues: “Explaining to a child why a fairy tale is so captivating to him destroys, moreover, the story’s enchantment, which depends to a considerable degree on the child’s not quite knowing why he is delighted by it. ... Adult interpretations, as correct as they may be, rob the child ...” (pp.18/19). In summary, we view enchantment as an experience of being caught up and carried away, in which, although we are disoriented, perception and attention are heightened. To the extent that it awakens us to wonder and to the wonder of life, it is enlivening. In contrast, if our first thought on encountering a new interactive system is that ‘... it is just like ...’—just like another system, or just like our bosses to impose this on us, or just like this software manufacturer—there is little chance of being enchanted. Moreover, even when our first response is to wonder at the newness and unexpectedness of a system, if as soon as we explore the system we meet reductive explanation, the opportunity for enchantment is again closed off. An object or interactive system that is likely to evoke enchantment should offer the potential for the unexpected, give the chance of new discoveries, and provide a range of possibilities. The greater the opportunity it offers for finding new aspects or qualities, the longer the enchantment may last. We can think of these characteristics as conferring depth upon a design. To the extent that designers of interactive systems are interested in the experience we have described above as enchantment, they must consider how the potential for enchantment can be tapped in media-saturated cultures. 3 Finding depth in media-saturated cultures Unlike the islanders studied by Gell, we live in highly technologically mediated cultures and we have become very knowledgeable about the media in our lives. Given the antagonistic relationship between knowledge and enchantment described earlier, we are bound to question whether enchantment by technology is still possible in media-saturated cultures. However, we would argue that it is not knowledge itself but a knowing disposition that forecloses on enchantment. As Fisher [11] shows, we can continue to be enchanted by a single painting as long as we continue to find something wonderful in it. This suggests that the painting must have a depth to it that keeps viewers involved, indeed the more involved the more they know about it. Conversely, the viewers must remain open to the potential in the painting and not foreclose on what might otherwise be an enchanting experience. These observations lead us to question what constitutes the depth of the painting and how to get such depth in an interactive system. Below we examine two examples where technology appears to have achieved some level of such enchantment even in a modern ‘media-saturated’ cultures. The cases we have chosen are film and the cell phone. Both are contemporary technologies, and they also differ in interesting ways that might help us uncover variety in their depth. For a start, while films are designed to enchant, cell phones turned out to be enchanting despite being originally designed as practical information and communication technologies. While film is already a technology always geared towards experience, the cell phone is primarily a tool. And while the depth and potential for enchantment in film can be attributed to the makers, the depth and potential for enchantment with cell phones have been created by users, who make it the means-and-end of perpetual contact for a youth subculture. 3.1 The enchantment of film The film experience is most readily associated with people sitting in a darkened cinema watching and listening, together and separately, enjoying and making sense of the film before them. However, it is important to realise the extent to which film and a variety of interactive technologies have begun to interpenetrate each other in interesting ways. The viewer has been given far more interactive control over their viewing of digital films, at least on digital television. Moreover, film appears to have become the model for many computer games and aspects of the film experience have been appropriated in applications involving design, architecture, and education. Although it is by no means common, we all have probably had the experience at some time or other of being enchanted by a film. When this happens we feel with the characters in the film; we are caught up in their world and carried away by the sensuousness of its expression in the film. The depth of a film and the potential for the viewer’s enchantment arises when the film evokes a world that seems to have a life of its own, i.e. open to ambiguity and even contradiction, and that resists any easy conclusions that the viewer might reach about it. The film must have a voice, a position or centre from which it speaks, and its distinct voice must participate in the transaction between viewer and film where the otherness of the film resists appropriation to self. Without this distinctive voice and this resistance there is none of the enchantment of being in play with the film. But how does a filmmaker create a world that has depth, that creates a moment of presence, and that reveals more with each viewing? Boorstin [13], a film writer and producer, explores the complex response of filmgoers that enables filmmakers to enchant with even simple filmic devices. He suggests that the depth of a film and the possibility for enchantment resides in an aesthetic that is at once sensory, intellectual, and emotional. He suggests that people experience or watch movies in three ways, each having a distinct pleasure associated with it. Boorstin refers to these ways of seeing as the voyeuristic eye, the vicarious eye, and the visceral eye. The voyeuristic eye experiences film in terms of the simple joy of seeing something new and the wonderful. It involves viewers looking closely and carefully at the film, but with some scepticism. This scepticism demands a high level of credibility, disengaging when events seem too implausible. What appears on screen must contain both surprise and plausibility to seduce and enchant the voyeuristic eye. However, designers should note that less can be more enchanting as long as it introduces us to new perceptions and wonder, even if in the process the very category of film is put in play. For example, Boorstin describes films by Charles Eames as miniature masterpieces because they make viewers see simple objects like spinning tops in a new way and they do so without story or characters. They stand or fall on voyeuristic pleasure and the visual logic threading through the images.</p>]]></content>

        <content><![CDATA[<p>INTRODUCTION Interaction design refers to the shaping of digital materials – software, electronics, telecommunication, etc. – with a particular focus on the use of the resulting digital artifacts. Websites, mobile phones, cross-media entertainment, locationbased information in public spaces, e-commerce, interactive art installations, medical rehabilitation technology, business administration software . . . these are a few examples of products and services that interaction designers may concern themselves with. Interaction design is a multidisciplinary field with an influential heritage from software engineering and applied psychology (including labels such as human factors, humancomputer interaction [HCI], and cognitive ergonomics). More recently, attempts have been made to treat interaction design as a design This paper starts from two observations. First, that there seems to be growing recognition in interaction design that there is something to learn from the more mature design disciplines in thinking about the user/ customer as a whole person with senses, feelings and desires. Second, that interaction design deals with a material with rather unique properties: Digital design materials are both genuinely temporal and genuinely spatial. The first observation merely means that there is a need for systematic knowledge construction in interaction design on qualities other than efficiency, relevance, and fitnessfor- purpose. The second observation, however, deserves a bit of elaboration. The spatial properties of a digital artifact are undeniable – it occupies a two-dimensional screen surface or a three-dimensional product shape; it has two- or three-dimensional form. To the (limited) extent that interaction design has concerned itself with issues of form, the main input so far has come from graphic design and industrial design. And to be sure, some genres of interaction design are predominantly spatial. There are physical devices with digital functions of low complexity, such as remote controls where buttons are mapped to functions in stateless interaction, which can be beneficially treated as pure industrial design projects. Some types of websites work well as sequences of graphic designs stringed together with the coarsegrained interaction of page-topage hyperlinks. However, we have all experienced the differences between watching a screenshot or a photograph of a digital artifact, and trying it out for real. The feel of the interaction, the hints of complexity unfolding as different options are explored, the rhythm of the initiative shifting back and forth, the sense of understanding and insight growing over time, the sometimes almost dramaturgical orchestration of the interaction from conflict to resolution – all of this is part of the temporal and visuo-tactile properties of using the digital artifact. With a slight simplification, we might say that graphic-design and industrialdesign products carry much of their meaning on the surface whereas interaction design products hide much of their meaning in virtual “contents” to Artifact | 2007 | Volume I, Issue 2 | Pages 85-95 86 emerge only in sustained interaction. The point is that interaction design needs to develop its own body of knowledge on desirable qualities of the use experience, qualities that take into account the synthesis of temporal and spatial that characterizes digital artifacts. Another way of putting it would be to say that we need to start articulating the aesthetics of interaction design. I use the word “aesthetic” here in a pragmatist sense, drawing on Dewey’s (1934) characterization of an aesthetic experience as something that integrates emotional, sensate, and cognitive aspects into an immediate whole. Dewey sketches a continuum of everyday experiences ranging from the mundane to the aesthetic, rather than confining aesthetics to galleries and other institutionally refined settings. Aesthetic experiences answer to our needs for a sense of meaning and wholeness, and push us over the threshold of doing something for its own sake. As Petersen et al. (2004) point out, aesthetic experience in this sense spans the analytical mind and the bodily experience. Further, I share Fels’s (2000) position that people have aesthetic experiences when they manipulate objects skillfully (see also McCullough, 1996). In this paper, I shall be concerned with one specific example of aesthetic experience in the use of digital artifacts. I propose the concept of pliability as a way to characterize a specific experiential quality, outline it by means of examples and discussion, and then discuss its scope and relevance for interaction design. PLIABILITY IN ACTION The notion of pliability is an attempt to articulate a certain quality in using digital, interactive products and services. The use of a digital artifact is characterized as pliable if it feels like a tightly connected loop between eye and hand, between action and response. A pliable interaction is one where the user is drawn into a sense of shaping the digital information with his/her fingertips, even though the actual artifact might employ standard, non-tactile interaction techniques such as mouse, keyboard, and display monitor. Pliability is a sensuous quality, having to do with how it feels to use the artifact in the hereand- now of the use situation, and as such it plays a role in understanding the aesthetics of interaction. This topic will be addressed further in the concluding discussion; the current section starts with a brief historical sketch and then moves on to an analysis of a number of digital artifacts from three different domains: online maps, digital-image management, and online thesauri. Within each domain, I have chosen examples that range from less pliable to more pliable, and it is my intention that the reader’s understanding of pliability will be furthered through the examples and my discussion of them rather than by abstract definitions. In the late 1980s, the use of databases was largely stereotyped as follows: you start with an empty search form, you type in your search criteria, you hit the Search button, you wait for a while, you receive a set of results that correspond to the criteria you entered (and also, it is hoped, to the intentions you had when searching the database). The overall character of the interaction was coarsegrained and stilted, essentially performed on the computer’s terms. Ben Shneiderman, Christopher Ahlberg, and their colleagues at the University of Maryland identified the stereotype of database use as dissonant with contemporary ideas of interactive information visualization as a captivating and exploratory experience. Shneiderman had generated the initial idea of visual dynamic queries and together with his coworkers produced a range of prototypes where the concept was refined for different applications. One of them was the FilmFinder from 1993 shown in Figure 1 (Ahlberg &amp; Shneiderman, 1994; see also Shneiderman, 1999, for more on the historical background). FilmFinder contains information on some 1500 video films. In the starting state, each movie is plotted as a colored dot with production year on the X-axis and popularity on the Y-axis. One might say that FilmFinder turns the regular movie database inside out: Instead of starting with an empty search form, it starts by showing the full dataset. Instead of searching, the user locates movies of interest by gradually applying filters through manipulating the gauges in the right half of the interface. For instance, if I start dragging the left knob of the duration gauge from its starting position at 0 minutes and to the right, what happens is that some of the colored dots disappear from the plot as I increase the lower bound of the duration filter. When I have reached Figure 1. The Film Finder. Artifact | 2007 | Volume I, Issue 2 | Pages 85-95 87 the point of, say, 180 minutes, only the dots remain that represent movies with a duration greater than three hours. Several filters can be combined to locate, for example, all movies longer than three hours that were recorded before 1980 with Charlton Heston as the male lead actor (epic of all epics: Ben Hur!). The whole point of dynamic queries is that every minute manipulation of the filters is instantly reflected in the plotted dataset. The connection between action and response feels very close and there is a certain sense of physically shaping the digital information, which can be quite captivating.1 Moreover, the fine-grained interaction may lead to discovery of unexpected regularities in the dataset. For example, I might discover while increasing the lower bound for duration that dots in the left half of the plot tend to disappear first, which would mean that short films were more common in the early history of movie production. This is perhaps not a revolutionary insight in itself, but it illustrates how more fine-grained interaction can create conditions for what is known as serendipitous discovery, i.e. to learn things about the dataset you didn’t know you were interested in. Dynamic queries are on some level instrumentally equivalent to conventional database queries: they enable the user to locate information in a relational database. However, their experiential qualities in use are quite different. For my purposes, the difference captures the basic quality of pliability rather well. I will now continue adding to the picture by discussing a range of contemporary digital artifacts and their pliability (or lack thereof). Geographical information The first set of examples concerns online searching for geographical information presented through maps. Figure 2 illustrates a typical yellow-pages website: you type in an address or the name of a company, institution, or landmark, you press Search, the result is presented on a map, you navigate the result by panning and zooming. This particular example was taken from the Swedish yellowpages site Eniro in April 2006 and it was a good representative of a large class of similar websites at the time of writing. The widespread geographical information service Google Maps is instrumentally identical to Eniro: type in search criteria, get result on map, navigate map, etc. However, they used to feel quite different in use. Navigating the Eniro map in the spring of 2006 was a clunky and large-grained interaction experience, where panning was accomplished by clicking the red frame of the map, waiting while the image updates, then concentrating hard to find the landmarks and reconcile the new view with the previous one. Zooming was similarly largegrained, with clicking on the zoom control and then waiting for the updated image to appear. In contrast, the Google map could be panned by dragging it with the mouse, which strongly enforced my sense of tactile involvement with the information and eliminated the effort of perceptual reconciliation. If I should prefer to use the pan buttons, the transition was animated reasonably smoothly, which again facilitates view reconciliation. Satellite images are combined with map information to emphasize the physical reality underlying the geographical information service. Zooming in Google Maps is regrettably no more fine-grained than in Eniro, probably for technical performance reasons. The net result, however, was that Google Maps illustrated a more pliable approach to geographical information services than Eniro, mainly due to its superior interaction technique for panning and its integration of photographic imagery with the symbolic iconography of regular maps. It is probably no coincidence that Eniro, like virtually any other online map service on the web, has implemented direct-manipulation panning and satellite photographs in the last year. A further step towards pliability is illustrated by Google Earth (Figure 3). The main difference compared with previous examples is that the third dimension is integrated in the design throughout. Zooming is no longer a tedious and instrumental operation of increasing map resolution to find the requested geographical information, but rather a visceral experience of traveling from outer space all the way down to the face of the earth (i.e. the map) at dizzying speed. The threedimensional representation also allows me to adjust the tilt of the camera and fly over the mountains; some regions have additional data such as 3D models of buildings and topography, which add further to the experience, and at large distances panning becomes perceptually equivalent to spinning the globe with your fingertips. In short, Google Earth is a highly pliable interface to geographical information. This quality comes at a price, of course, and in this case the price is that the user has to download and install a separate client in order to achieve the level of graphics performance and responsiveness needed to provide the richer experience. The three examples so far all rely on standard interaction techniques: a mouse, a keyboard, and a display monitor. Other examples exist that illustrate the tactile nature of pliability and provide more literal interpretations of what the use experience of “shaping the digital information with your fingertips” might entail. The Multi-Touch Interaction technology by Han (2005) demonstrates how far a touchscreen can be pushed in terms of resolution and responsiveness. One of the MTI demos shown in the video (Han, 2006) is a geographic information service that appears to be very similar to Google Earth in terms of functionality (Figure 4). The impression you get from the video, however, is that two-handed input directly on the display surface adds even more pliability to the use experience.</p>]]></content>

        <content><![CDATA[<p>Take a ride on the subway, stop by the mall, or go anywhere near a high school and you’ll encounter the most recent evolution of the human race. Small, light-emitting plastic screens attached to people’s hands are just about anywhere you look. Thankfully, this isn’t some odd genetic mutation— it’s just our friend, the mobile device. And he’s everywhere. In case you haven’t been keeping up with the latest stats, I’ll give you a quick recap: mobile is growing like crazy. (Really technical, I know.) While analysts have predicted for years that mobile will be “the next big thing,” their prophecies are finally coming true in a very big way. To understand just how big, let’s look at some recent statistics: • Smartphones were boldly predicted to out-ship the combined global market of laptop, desktop, and notebook computers in 2012. They did so in the last quarter of 2010 (http://bkaprt.com/mf/4, PDF; fig 1.1)—two years earlier than predicted! 8 MOBILE FIRST • That means more people will be using mobile devices to access the web than those getting online with desktops and laptops. This transition has already started. Home usage of personal computers in 2010 was down 20% from 2008 in the United States. The culprit? Smartphones and tablets gobbling up our time online (http://bkaprt.com/mf/5). • As further proof, consider that in November 2010 visitors to web-based email sites declined 6%, but visitors accessing email with their mobile devices grew by 36% (http://bkaprt. com/mf/6). • Traffic to mobile websites in 2010 grew 600% after tripling between 2009 and 2010 (http://bkaprt.com/mf/7). • And it’s only going to get bigger. While half a billion people accessed the mobile internet worldwide in 2009, heavy mobile data users will triple to one billion by 2013 (http:// bkaprt.com/mf/8; http://bkaprt.com/mf/9, PDF). • So it’s not hard to imagine how another bold prediction like “mobile phones will overtake PCs as the most common web access devices worldwide by 2013” will happen much earlier than predicted as well (http://bkaprt.com/mf/10). 2005 Global Shipments in MM SMARTPHONES PCS 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010E 2011E 2012E 2013E Q42010 2012E Fig 1.1: Global smartphone shipments surpassed global PC shipments two years earlier than predicted. (Sources: http://bkaprt.com/mf/11 and http://bkaprt.com/mf/12.) Growth 9 There aren’t just a lot more bits flying around on mobile networks. Actual businesses are flourishing on mobile in ecommerce, social, search, and beyond. That’s right—real money is being made on mobile, which makes clients and stakeholders take note. • PayPal is seeing up to $10 million in mobile payment volume per day (http://bkaprt.com/mf/11). • eBay’s global mobile sales generated nearly $2 billion in 2010 (http://bkaprt.com/mf/12). • Google’s mobile searches grew 130% in the third quarter of 2010 (http://bkaprt.com/mf/13). • Of Pandora’s total user base, 50% subscribe to the service on mobile (http://bkaprt.com/mf/12). And just in case you think your website or application is immune, the average smartphone user visits up to 24 websites a day and the top 50% of websites only account for 40% of all mobile visits (http://bkaprt.com/mf/14). That means your site is very likely a part of the mobile growth story as well. Truthfully, you don’t need all these statistics to realize that mobile use is exploding. You just need to look around you and see how often people are staring at the little screen in their hand. Mobile is already all around us. SO WHAT CHANGED? To explain why mobile is on such a tear, I need to take us on a US history lesson all the way back to 2006. If you can’t imagine what life was like way back then, let me re-introduce you to the Motorola Z3: a follow-up to the incredibly popular Motorola RAZR phone (fig 1.2). The Z3 was a high-end mobile device in the United States in 2006. It featured SMS, email, instant messaging, a two megapixel camera, a music player, a full color screen, and a WAP 2.0/XHTML web browser; it connected to AT&amp;T’s EDGE high-speed data network, and the experience of using the web on it...sucked. 10 MOBILE FIRST Just how bad was it? I counted almost two minutes from starting the web browser to finally seeing a web page that consisted of just a few text links (http://bkaprt.com/mf/15). In a world where websites measure their response times in milliseconds, it’s not hard to see how painful that could feel. But it wasn’t just the wait; using the phone’s keypad to triple-tap text was a chore, and even predictive text tools like T9 (http:// bkaprt.com/mf/16) didn’t fully ease the pain. But something happened less than a year later that really changed things. On June 29, 2007, Steve Jobs got on stage and introduced the first iPhone. Apple fanboy or not, it’s hard to deny the impact this device has had on the mobile internet. Here was a mobile phone on which browsing the web really did not suck. Looking at AT&amp;T’s mobile data traffic from 2006 to 2009 (when it was the exclusive carrier of the iPhone in the US) tells the story quite clearly (fig 1.3). During this time period, AT&amp;T saw a 4,932% increase in mobile data traffic (http://bkaprt.com/mf/9; PDF)—no wonder their service was spotty for so long! The difference between a device that sucks for browsing the web and one that is great Fig 1.2: The Motorola Z3 mobile phone was state-of-the-art in the US back in 2006. Growth 11 for browsing the web is actually quite significant. In fact, in 2009, one iPhone was responsible for as much mobile traffic as 30 basic feature phones (http://bkaprt.com/mf/17)—no doubt aided by the flat-fee data plan available with the device. But mobile isn’t growing just because devices are getting better: they’re getting cheaper as well. People who could never afford a desktop or laptop computer can now get online using inexpensive mobile devices and increasingly affordable data plans. Broader coverage from faster networks has also been adding fuel to the fire. In 2010 alone, mobile network speeds doubled. As networks became twice as fast, the average amount of data traffic used per smartphone doubled as well. And this use of this data isn’t going to stop anytime soon; global mobile data traffic is projected to increase 26-fold between 2010 and 2015 (http://bkaprt.com/mf/17)! That’s a whole lot of opportunity coming your way, really fast. 2006 Motorola Z3 iPhone iPhone 3G iPhone 3GS 2007 2008 2009 Fig 1.3: AT&amp;T’s meteoric rise in mobile data traffic can be seen in more detail at http:// bkaprt.com/mf/9. (Source: AT&amp;T, Morgan Stanley Research.) 12 MOBILE FIRST ALL DEVICES ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL But before we get ahead of ourselves with pie-in-the-sky mobile web usage fantasies, let’s ground things a bit. First, mobile data traffic includes a lot more than just the web. Second, basic feature phones still make up the vast majority of devices on the mobile network and there’s a world of difference between feature phone use and usage of more capable mobile devices. Just what kinds of differences are we talking about? • Of smartphone owners, 35% browse the mobile internet at least daily, versus only 4% of feature phone owners. • Of smartphone users, 31% have accessed social networks using their mobile browser, compared to only 7% of feature phone users. • Of smartphone users, 70% have accessed email on their mobile device, versus only 12% of feature phone users. • And all this was in 2009! Plus this data includes “smartphones” with painful web browsers as well (http:// bkaprt.com/mf/18). So chances are there’s an even bigger gap today. To ensure everyone on the mobile web can access your content now you would need a solution for feature phones, smartphones, and everything in between. But in this book, I’m going to focus mostly on designing for smartphones. Not because Google is giving me a kickback for every Android phone sold, but because: • Smartphones have a disproportionate amount of web and data usage. According to Cisco, smartphones represent only 13% of total global handsets in use today, but they make up 78% of total handset traffic (source: http:// bkaprt.com/mf/19; PDF). • The rate of smartphone adoption is extremely fast and getting faster. In the third quarter of 2010, smartphone sales grew 96% from the previous year. Many more people are getting smartphones every single day (http://bkaprt.com/20). Growth 13 • With each new volley of devices, smartphones are getting more and more affordable. What previously cost several hundred dollars is now approaching $100 and below; this opens up a huge new market of users. • So it’s not outlandish to suggest that today’s smartphone will simply be tomorrow’s “phone.” For these reasons and more, smartphones represent a huge opportunity for immediate and long-term customer engagement for many companies. There are, of course, many opportunities with the vast number of feature phones out there today as well—especially through integrated services like SMS and specialized mobile browsers like OperaMini (which does a nice job of bringing better web browsing to feature phones). However, the mobile industry is moving toward smartphones, and so will this book. But every device labeled a smartphone isn’t created equally, either. At the beginning of 2010, iPhone data usage was over four times higher than any other smartphone platform. But by the end of the year, other mobile devices had caught up, and iPhone data usage was only 1.75 times higher than Google’s Android platform (http://bkaprt.com/mf/17). Usage can also change dramatically within a single platform. When Research in Motion (RIM) introduced a more capable web browser with their Storm mobile device, it quickly shot up to 16% of all of RIM’s mobile traffic on the Verizon network (http://bkaprt.com/mf/21). The Blackberry devices made by RIM today have an even better web browser so expect usage to grow even more. These examples not only illustrate the impact a more capable mobile device can have on usage; they also highlight just how quickly things are changing. The rate of innovation in mobile devices is unparalleled; as a result, it’s creating all kinds of new opportunities. With new capabilities come new ways to interact with the web and with digital services, information, and people. We’ll talk a lot more about this later in the book, but for now I just want to point out that more capable devices and faster 14 MOBILE FIRST networks don’t just amount to more traffic to your site. They introduce entirely new opportunities for engagement as well. Consider the local review service, Yelp. Their mobile products are used by just 7% of their total audience but are responsible for 35% of all their searches. Every other second Yelp’s mobile products manage a call to a local business or a request for driving directions (http://bkaprt.com/mf/22). That’s a whole new set of interactions Yelp didn’t have before people started using their service on mobile devices. As another example, let’s look at the real estate service, Zillow. Their customers are viewing active listings 45% more often from mobile devices—compared to their desktop website (http://bkaprt.com/mf/23). These are primarily active buyers on location or scoping out neighborhoods; they represent a new kind of audience for the company created by the growth of mobile. WHAT ABOUT THE NATIVES? Of course we can’t talk about mobile internet growth without mentioning the ongoing debate between native mobile applications and mobile web solutions. While many people try to argue for one side or the other, the truth is there are great reasons for doing both. Because native mobile applications run, well—natively— they have access to system resources that web applications do not. This means user interface transitions and interactions are generally smoother in native applications. Trying to replicate these effects in the browser can lead to noticeable hiccups and lags in the user experience. Native mobile applications give you robust access to hardware capabilities that you currently can’t get through mobile web browsers. Core features like access to the address book, SMS, camera, audio inputs, and other built-in sensors are mostly unavailable. Also absent is the ability to run processes in the background and easily monetize through mobile app stores or in-app purchases. Non-native applications can’t get into a native app store and have a much harder time getting on Growth 15 the home screen of people’s mobile devices, which can negatively impact discovery and ongoing usage. So if your mobile product or business requires deeper hardware access, background processes, app or in-app sales, or more integrated placement on mobile devices to be viable, you may need a native solution. But that doesn’t mean you don’t need a mobile web solution, too. As mobile strategist Jason Grigsby is fond of pointing out, “Web links don’t open apps, they go to web pages,” (http:// bkaprt.com/mf/24). Whether it’s through search, email, social networks, or on web pages, if you have content online, people will find and share links to it. Not having a mobile web solution means anyone that follows those links on a mobile device won’t have a great experience (if they can even access your content at all). Having a native mobile application won’t help (fig 1.4).￼ Access might even be the biggest user benefit for a mobile web experience. Even if you build a native mobile application for one platform, chances are you won’t be able to create one for every platform. Apple’s iOS requires Objective C; Google’s Android needs Java; Microsoft’s Windows Phone 7 relies on Fig 1.4: Even though they have native mobile applications for iOS, Android, Blackberry, and Palm, the locationbased service Gowalla also has a mobile web experience for anyone following links to Gowalla on their mobile device. 16 MOBILE FIRST Silverlight; Samsung’s Bada requires C++; RIM’s Blackberry has Java, WebWorks, and Adobe Air solutions. Finding a company that can build something for all of these technologies is rare. And even if you can create native applications for each platform, the cost of maintaining them can quickly make it prohibitive. Plus the web might be your most popular mobile experience anyway. Fourteen percent of Twitter’s members use the mobile web experience compared to 8% using the native iPhone app and 7% using the Blackberry native app. The rest of Twitter’s native mobile applications are each used by less than 4% of their user base (http://bkaprt.com/mf/25). The same pattern can be found on Facebook. Close to 19% of Facebook posts are created on the mobile web experience, while Facebook’s native iPhone, Android, and Blackberry apps only account for about 4% of posts each (http://bkaprt.com/ mf/26). It turns out access (anywhere) goes a long way. In fact, native mobile applications are actually increasing web use on mobile devices. Each time a web link is shared or referenced in a native application it opens in a web browser window. So more native application use quickly turns into more web use. Mobile web experiences also don’t require users to download updates (a fix on the server is a fix on the site), and they enable you to do frequent A/B (or bucket) testing of multiple design options. If either of those considerations is of vital importance to you, a mobile web application can make more sense. But perhaps the best reason to start with a mobile web solution is that it builds on web design and development skills you already have. You don’t have to wait to get started. In fact, I think you should start right away</p>]]></content>

        <content><![CDATA[<p>A scenario is a description of a set of users, a work context, and a set of tasks that users perform or want to perform. A scenario sketches future technologies that will help users do the things they want to do. A scenario blends a carefully researched description of some set of real ongoing activities with an imaginative futuristic look at how technology could support those activities better. The purpose of a scenario is to provide an explicit concrete vision of how some human activity could be supported by technology. Within a research lab, there are several good uses for such a vision. Scenarios provide a basis for discussion among researchers working on different aspects of the technology. They allow researchers to explain to others what they are doing. Scenarios depict a holistic activity in a well-defined setting; hence they can be used to show which aspects of a technology a lab will actively work on, which it will get from somewhere else, and which it will ignore (at least for some period of time). Scenarios are one good reference point for making design decisions. By showing the actual circumstances under which people work, scenarios provide guidelines on how a technology should perform. The very act of making things explicit and clear also helps in making design choices. An important feature of a scenario is that it depicts activities in a full context, describing the social setting, resources, and goals of users. It is not a narrowly focused task description, but the "big picture" of how some particular kind of work gets done. Having a description of the fuller context in which people work provides a means of allowing us to think about such issues as collaborative work, distributed data, and the diversity of resources that people actually use in solving problems. Rather than confining our imaginations to the simplistic, unrealistic user-computer dyad (one user, one computer) we begin to see a much bigger set of links that we can support - collaborating groups of users creating and sharing many kinds of diverse data with an array of technology supports such as printers, scanners, instruments, multimedia devices. For a scenario to be good, it must realistically depict some actual human activity. A scenario must "bring to life" for its readers the activity that is to be supported. A vivid compelling description is grounded in a coherent story that has the imprimatur of reality, and the kinds of illustrative details that stimulate interest and understanding. It is also important that researchers be able to go back to the source of the scenario and fill in gaps as questions arise. The "database" of a real world activity makes this possible. The appropriate methods for scenario generation are a combination of ethnography (naturalistic study of everyday human activity) with a sort of technological free association. Just as it is important to obtain a faithful rendering of some actual work activity, it is also important to be creative, even farreaching, in imagining new technologies. Scenarios combine a rigorous anthropology with a shake-loose technical creativity. WHAT A SCENARIO IS NOT A scenario is not a description by end users - their interests are far too parochial to develop a scenario useful in a research lab. While it is very important to understand things from users' perspectives, the data from interacting with users (i.e. interviews, observations, and the collection of artifacts such as lab notebooks or instrument output) must be sifted and analyzed by someone who has research goals in mind. A scenario is not the same as user requirements. A scenario contains ideas for future technologies that may go far beyond what users are capable of imagining could even be supported. Users' goals and needs are of course important data for a scenario, but they are not the scenario. User requirements tend to be laundry lists. A scenario is a description of an activity, in narrative form. A scenario is not the answer to all our problems. It is not a strategy; it is one aspect of tactics. Scenarios are selected and informed by wider organizational strategies, business needs and technical opportunities. Here at HP, for example, we are likely, to select a medical or manufacturing scenario, but not likely to select a banking scenario, as banking it not a central HP focus. We are likely to select a scenario in which open distributed systems play a role, but not a scenario of single user PC's. Hewlett Packard Laboratories, 1501 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304; EMAIL:nardi@hpl.hp.com Also published as HPL Tech Report: HPL-92-49. SIGCHI Bulletin October 1992 13 ~lume 24, Number4 WHAT EXACTLY DOES A SCENARIO LOOK LIKE? A scenario is a narrative. A basic scenario should be one to two pages long, though it might contain appendices with further detail and clarification. A scenario is meant to suggest and express; it cannot be a daunting weighty document that discourages perusal, but should be a pithy, lively page or two of well-crafted prose. The true test of a scenario should be that everyone in the lab has read it and can verbally explain it. The properties of a good scenario include believability (hence the importance of the ethnographic research that backs up the scenario as well as informed technical input), relevance to business needs, fascination (a remote consultation during open heart surgery makes a better scenario than a remote conference attended by accountants), and simplicity (we can all remember and repeat it). HOW TO USE SCENARIOS A common reaction to the idea of scenarios is that they focus too much, they eliminate possibilities, they put researchers in a straitjacket. Some of what a scenario reveals is relevant only to the particular area that it describes. The use of one distinguished scenario for all of a lab could possibly have these effects. For this reason, multiple scenarios are called for. Different scenarios develop different interesting aspects of problems to be worked on. At the same time, through the study of multiple scenarios the discovery what is common to all becomes possible, and that will suggest areas of interest. Scenarios are a complement to demonstrator systems. A set of carefiAly chosen scenarios, taken together, will help reveal the larger problems a lab has chosen in a way that demonstrators cannot. A demonstrator system, no matter how well executed, cannot provide the breadth of a collection of scenarios. This is particularly important for infrastructural work that does not "demo" well. A demonstrator also runs much more risk of bogging down as a set of "point solutions" to one problem. We should balance and integrate the use of scenarios and demonstrators. Scenarios provide input to demonstrators, while maintaining much more scope as they describe a bigger picture than a single demonstrator can. While we work on demonstrators, scenarios will help us to maintain the big picture. Scenarios can be used to drive "vertical slice" analysis. A vertical slice specifies software requirements at each software layer for some aspect of functionality that is to be supported. For example, a hypertext system may have requirements at many levels - the user interface toolkit, the object system, a database. Such software layers may interact or conflict or be completely inadequate in some way. An analysis of needs and problems that looks across the various layers is critical in the design process. A scenario allows designers to anticipate requirements at each level and to make provisions for them. A scenario can be perturbed to good effect; that is, its baseline assumptions about technology can be changed to stimulate new ideas about future technologies. For example, we might imagine the kinds of technologies we would build given the widespread availability of high speed networks. THE LIVES OF A SCENARIO Scenarios, like everything else, have a natural life cycle. They are especially valuable at the beginning of a research effort, but less so as time goes on, and prototypes of the technology under development begin to emerge. As this happens, scenario development segues into testing of prototypes and empirical studies of their use. A scenario is by nature sketchy, and remains that way. Though it will evolve from its first beginnings as its gaps are filled in, it does not significantly deepen or ripen over time, but is cast off as its function of stimulating technology development yields research prototypes. Scenarios may continue to be usefill into their old age in explaining what a lab is up to, but they do not exert significant influence over the design process as projects mature. Design is then, ideally, guided by empirical studies of actual use of the prototypes. GETTING STARTED WITH SCENARIOS To start with, a lab can develop one scenario that will serve as the exemplar for further scenarios. Two people working full time for three weeks should be allocated to complete one scenario. Scenario development involves selecting a problem area, interviewing knowledgeable people in that area, brainstorming new technologies to support the users' activities, and writing a 1-2 page scenario description. Scenario developers need interviewing and writing skills as well as technical imagination and understanding. These skills could be distributed across two people, e.g. one researcher might be an especially good interviewer while the other has strong writing skills and technical depth. Once one good scenario is in place, the lab can go on to develop other scenarios, generating a portfolio of multiple scenarios to provide the scope and coverage needed for research activities.</p>]]></content>
